<h2>Lyric Search Final Project for INST377</h2>
<p>Targeted browsers would be both iOS and android.</p>
<p><h2>Description of the project</h2></p>
<p><ol>Postman's lyric search API</p>
<p>Produces song lyrics from artists or song titles searched</p>
<p>I used the jQeuery javascript library</p>
<p>This project was supposed to handle taking in lyrics and producing the song title and artists. But it takes in the song title or artist and produces a set of lyrics. I inital problem was to be able to look up partial song lyrics that you hear from a song out at a restraunt or at a party where it's actually too loud to really get a good grasp on it. Being able to search partial lyrics and maybe even genres could quickly help people find the song that were looking for. </p></ol>
